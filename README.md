# STM32-Bare-Matel-Application
STM32 Discovery LED Blink Project (Bare Metal Application)

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple LED blink application on the STM32 Discovery board using a bare metal approach. The application controls four LEDs and adjusts the blinking rate using a button.

## Requirements
To successfully run this project, you'll need the following:

1. STM32 Discovery Board (e.g., STM32F4 Discovery)
2. GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
3. TRACE32 Debugger (optional, for flashing)
4. USB Cable for board power

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.
3. Build the project to generate the binary file.
5. Connect your STM32 Discovery board to your computer.
6. Flash the generated binary onto the board using your preferred method (TRACE32 Debugger or other flashing tools).
7. Reset the board.

## Usage
After flashing the binary onto the board, the LEDs should start blinking. Press the button to adjust the blinking rate.
